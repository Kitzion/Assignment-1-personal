        <p>My name is Ian Andrews.<br> My OSU email is andrewia@oregonstate.edu.<br> My major is computer science and I am a sophomore.</p>
        <h2>Q & A</h2>
        <p>The most complex and tedious thing I have had to do with my current coding skills all together was remaking towers of hanoi.<br> I hope to gain more insight into the reasoning and logic behind computer theory and the logic pertaining to the internet and web development as compared to other coding environments.</p>
        <p><br> I have signed up for the campuswire forum, but I was unaware of a piazza one.<br> One of the most interesting experiences I've had actually pertains to coding and it was getting to go to stanford and spend two weeks being taught javascript for minecraft modding.</p>
